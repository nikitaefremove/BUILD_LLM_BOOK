Doubled classification speed by optimizing and refactoring the tokenization and inference code. Other achievements: Created a service for convenient employee selection in internal audit using web scraping and NLP libraries. Enhanced a service analyzing hired and dismissed employees by adding interactive visualization through a dashboard. 3. ML Engineer / Freelance Projects Recommendation system application  based on FastAPI and CatBoost. Integration with the PostgreSQL database. The system, using a content-based approach, analyzes user and post data employing methods like K-Means, One-Hot Encoding (OHE), and creating embeddings using Pytorch and the Bert model, to provide the top-5 recommendations for each user. Phrase Similarity Analysis System — is a tool that helps identify phrases in a text sample similar to a predefined set of standard phrases, using cosine similarity with BERT embeddings. Web Scraping and Analytical Overview of IMDb's Top 250 Movies — Within the scope of the project, data was collected from the IMDb portal using the Selenium technology. After data accumulation, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify key cinematic trends: determining the most successful decade, highlighting the leading director and actor frequently mentioned in the list of best movies. Master's degree in Economics (Economic Security). ##Next I will provide you job description.
